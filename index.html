<p><b>Testdown</b> is a language for writing website smoke tests in
plain text:

<p><samp>Click the recipe "banana smoothie". Wait. Look at the recipe
pane. See some ingredients: "banana", "honey".
</samp>

<p>The simple language encourages high-level testing. A handful of
verbs are enough to exercise much of a web site's functionality.

<p>Meaningful names instead of cryptic selectors make for clear and
maintainable test suites.

<p>Test suites are valid Markdown files, so non-coders can read them
as rich text documents.

<p>Testdown comes with a JavaScript-based test runner for single-page
apps.  Run tests from your regular browser using the
test <abbr title="Heads-Up Display">HUD</abbr> or in continuous
integration using WebDriver.

<p><b>Notes:</b>

<p>A noun phrase like <i>the thing</i> will locate an element whose
role is set to "thing".

<p>You can also use <i>the thing "foo"</i> to select a thing that
contains the text "foo" anywhere in its content.

<p>"Look at" changes where the robot looks for elements. It starts at
the root and resets with every scenario.

<p>You can use compound words like "recipe search box" for roles, too.
